    "## Getting Started with OpenDataCube\n",
    "A \"datacube\" is a digital information architecture that specialises in hosting and cataloguing spatial information.\n",
    "Piksel is an Indonesian implementation of the [Open Data Cube](https://www.opendatacube.org/) infrastructure, and specialises in storing remotely sensed data, particularly from Earth Observation satellites such as [Landsat](https://landsat.gsfc.nasa.gov/) and [Sentinel-2](https://www.copernicus.eu/en/about-copernicus/infrastructure/discover-our-satellites).\n",
    "\n",
    "The Piksel datacube currently contains analysis-ready satellite data, and in the future will also contain derivative data \"products\".\n",
    "These data datasets and products are often composed of a range of \"measurements\" such as the suite of remote sensing band values or statistical product summaries. Before running a query to load data from the datacube, it is useful to know what it contains.\n",

    "This notebook demonstrates several straightforward ways to inspect the product and measurement contents of a datacube.\n",
